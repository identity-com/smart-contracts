## Project structure

The project follows the Truffle framework basic structure:
 - `migrations` folder for the migration files
 - `contracts` folder for smart contract source code files
 - `test` for smart contracts unit tests
 - `truffle.js` file at the top level for network management.
 
# Testing

All tests are running against Truffle's Ganache.
We have the `docker-compose.yml` file with default setup for ganache to speed up environment setup.

To run the tests:

```
npm test
```

To run the tests with the [tenderly proxy](https://github.com/Tenderly/tenderly-cli/);

```
// in one shell
npm run tenderly-proxy
// in another shell
NETWORK=proxy npm test
```

See `package.json` for other available testing commands.

# Running migrations

Setup connection to your ethereum node (ganache/privatenet/testnet/mainnet). 
Run `deploy-contracts` npm command. 
Resulting JSON artifacts with ABIs and network addresses will be in `artifacts/deployed` folder.
